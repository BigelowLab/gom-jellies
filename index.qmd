```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
source("setup.R")
coast = read_coast()
```

For the [Jellyscape](https://github.com/BigelowLab/jellyscape) project observations are drawn from a recent release of unstaged [ECOMON](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northeast-fisheries-science-centern) data. We choose the following groups to belong to the gelatinous "jellyscape" although the list is easily modified.

  + *Siphonophores* (siph)
  + *Hydromedusea* (hydrom)
  + *Coelenterates* (coel)
  + *Ctenophores* (ctenop)
  + *Salps* (salps)

These we can read from the [ecomon package](https://github.com/BigelowLab/ecomon) and aggregate these species into a count per unit area (10m^2) or count per unit volume (100m^3). Accepting the defaults for the `read_ecomon_spp()` function yields an aggregated (summed) table for areal abundance for the `r length(groups)` groups listed.
